Database project overview

Project Overview
The WISS project is a comprehensive human resources management system implemented as a SQL Server database. It provides a robust foundation for tracking employee information, departmental structures, positions, and performance evaluations while implementing proper security controls and audit mechanisms. The system features well-designed tables with appropriate relationships, stored procedures for data manipulation, triggers for audit logging, views for simplified data access, and role-based security to enforce proper access controls.
Strengths of Your Implementation

Database Structure: Your schema design is logically organized with appropriate relationships between tables, constraints, and data types.
Security Implementation: The role-based security model with different user types (Admin, HR, Manager, Employee) demonstrates proper access control principles.
Audit Capabilities: The implementation of triggers to track changes to employee records shows attention to data governance.
Stored Procedures: The comprehensive set of procedures for CRUD operations and reporting demonstrates good encapsulation of business logic.
Views: The creation of views for common data access patterns simplifies querying and enforces security.
Test Queries: The inclusion of test queries helps validate the functionality and demonstrates how to use the system.
Hierarchical Data: The employee reporting structure implementation shows understanding of advanced SQL concepts.
Error Handling: Proper transaction management and error handling in stored procedures ensures data integrity.
